# Trains

A fast-paced mine cart management game where timing is everything!

## About

Set deep in the mines, you're tasked with maximizing mineral extraction while keeping the mine carts from colliding. The challenge? You can't control the carts' paths directly - only their speed. Master the art of timing to speed up carts at just the right moment to avoid catastrophic collisions and carry out as many minerals as possible.

## Gameplay

Use your ability to speed up individual carts strategically to prevent them from bumping into each other. The more minerals you successfully extract, the higher your score!
